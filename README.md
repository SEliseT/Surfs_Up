Surfs Up Analysis


Part 1 – Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to discover temperature statistics for June and December to determine if it is sustainable to run a surf shop at this location year-round. In order to derive the temperature data, two separate queries were ran (one for June and one for December). Once this step was complete, the temperatures were stored in a list to be converted to a dataframe. Upon creation of that dataframe, we obtained out summary statistics by utilizing the ”.describe()” method. 
Part 2 – Results and Discussion of Findings
The following was discovered:
December:
Count: 1517 | Mean: 71.0 | 
Min: 56.0 | Max: 83.0	June:
Count: 1700 | Mean: 74.9 | 
Min: 64.0 | Max: 85.0
 	 
The standard deviation is 3.25 while in June it is 3.75, making a 0.5 difference between the two seasons. 
Part 3 – Conclusion:
The available data displays what the temperatures are. There is not a drastic temperature shift between the seasons. However, other factors to weather such as precipitation must be taken into consideration as well. It would be beneficial to run additional queries to find out if the overall weather is conducive to customers visiting the shop year-round. If we can gain access to more data for the area, additional queries can be run. Once we have more robust insight regarding the overall weather from season to season, we can determine the following:
•	How to build the shop
•	What areas would make the location more prominent fo
